Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

## Syntax highlighting

Code examples can help illustrate your text.

```js {4}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({})
```

### Subheadings

- And bullet points [containing links](#).
- Or not, plain text is fine too.

:::note
Each theme has unique quirks and styles. You could make one too!
:::

### Keeping Houston happy

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest
```

## Next steps

1. Take screenshots for the different themes
2. Make a PR!
